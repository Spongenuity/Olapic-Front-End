## Q1 -- Integration inquiry


Is there an Olapic integration with Demandware? We are in the process of moving to Demandware; if we decided to use Demandware, how would
we go about doing that?


**A1:**
```
Hi,

Yes there is an integration with Demandware, there is a full integration that can be downloaded directly from the Salesforce Commerce Cloud.

The integration includes the Product Feed, Analytics script intergation and Widget management, so you should be able to move over seamlessly.

I've attached a link below for you to download the integration, there should also be some more information and some case studys for you to look through.

I hope that helps.

Please don't hesitate if you have any further questions,

Thanks.

## Q2 -- API vs. SDK
We're considering both your RESTful API integration and iOS SDK integration for our new iOS app. Which one is the better choice for our mobile
app?

Note: API documentation can be found here: http://photorank.me/api.html & iOS documentation can be found here: https://github.com/Olapic/Olapic-SDK-iOS

## Q3 -- Deployment issue
Hi Olapic! I'm saving changes to my templates in your markup editor, but the CSS changes are not appearing when I view the widget. Does your
platform have any limitations that I should be aware of?
Note: It takes about 45 minutes for templates to deploy from sandbox to production environment. There is a button in Olapic admin that allows you
to do this.

## Q4 -- Customization request
Unless Olapic JS widgets support IE8, it looks like we may have to take our business elsewhere. What can you do to make this happen?
Note: Olapic widgets only support IE9+ and modern browsers. Olapic API is often used as an alternative to Olapic JS widgets.

## Q5 -- Unhappy customer
Our widgets are down! You sent us an email saying our new API key is ready and now we're getting a message saying API key expired!
Note: Due to a bug on our side, the API key that was generated for them was expired at the time they received it. The new API key is now ready
for them to access in their Olapic account.

## Product feed inquiry
Hi Olapic. Here's a sample of our product feed in your Olapic schema. (Sample feed on Appendix of this documentation.) I created this according
to your documentation: 

`http://olapic.github.io/PublicDocs/product-feed-full-public.html#Validating-your-feed.`
 
Please take a look & import this into my account, and let me know when it's done.
Note: Olapic product feeds must be validated before it is queued up for ingestion.

Also please include the issues you caught from their feed in an
Appendix to your responses.
