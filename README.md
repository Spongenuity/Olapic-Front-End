## Q1 -- Integration inquiry


Is there an Olapic integration with Demandware? We are in the process of moving to Demandware; if we decided to use Demandware, how would
we go about doing that?


**A1:**

Hi,

Yes there is an integration with Demandware, there is a full integration that can be downloaded directly from the Salesforce Commerce Cloud.

The integration includes the Product Feed, Analytics script intergation and Widget management, so you should be able to move over seamlessly.

I've attached a link below for you to download the integration, there should also be some more information and some case studys for you to look through.

I hope that helps.

Please don't hesitate if you have any further questions,

Thanks.

## Q2 -- API vs. SDK
We're considering both your RESTful API integration and iOS SDK integration for our new iOS app. Which one is the better choice for our mobile
app?

Note: API documentation can be found here: http://photorank.me/api.html & iOS documentation can be found here: https://github.com/Olapic/Olapic-SDK-iOS

Hi,

Depending on how you have built the app itself, it could be one or the other.

In the case that your app is a nativly built and uses Cocoapods, then it would be recommended to use the SDK, as there should be seamless integration to install the framework.

However, if the app has been built with React Native or Ionic, the RESTful API may be the better option as the data can easily be pulled with a GET request.

I have attached some documentation below for you to help you make you're descision

Also, if you have any more information on your apps build, feel free to shoot them over and I can assist you further.

## Q3 -- Deployment issue
Hi Olapic! I'm saving changes to my templates in your markup editor, but the CSS changes are not appearing when I view the widget. Does your
platform have any limitations that I should be aware of?

*Note: It takes about 45 minutes for templates to deploy from sandbox to production environment. There is a button in Olapic admin that allows you to do this.*

**A3:**
```
Hi,

Thanks for your question!

Once you've made your changed on the markup editor, there is a button on the Olapic Admin which will let you push the changes to the production environment.

Once you've pushed the changes, this deployment process should take about 45 minutes.

Thanks.
```

## Q4 -- Customization request
Unless Olapic JS widgets support IE8, it looks like we may have to take our business elsewhere. What can you do to make this happen?

*Note: Olapic widgets only support IE9+ and modern browsers. Olapic API is often used as an alternative to Olapic JS widgets.*

**A4:**
```
Hello,

I'm sorry to hear that you're having some technical issues.

As noted in the documentation, Olapic widgets only support IE9+. An alternative method however would be to use out JS widgets.

I've attached the documentation to the API which should be able to help

Thanks!

## Q5 -- Unhappy customer
Our widgets are down! You sent us an email saying our new API key is ready and now we're getting a message saying API key expired!

*Note: Due to a bug on our side, the API key that was generated for them was expired at the time they received it. The new API key is now ready for them to access in their Olapic account.*

**A5:**
```
Hi,

I'm sorry to hear that you're having a technical issue at the moment.

It looks like there was a slight issue on our side and the API key expired at the time you had recieved it.
This has now been fixed and you should now have a new API key that can give you access.

I'm sorry for any inconvenience.

Thanks.
```

**Rationale/Sources:**
```
The best way to handle this situation is to come with a solution, since the issue has been fixed, its better to explain the error and apologise.

## Product feed inquiry
Hi Olapic. Here's a sample of our product feed in your Olapic schema. (Sample feed on Appendix of this documentation.) I created this according

Please take a look & import this into my account, and let me know when it's done.
